Validation Result: Failed
Justification: The proposed sub_questions do not meet the defined criteria. Specifically: 
1. The first sub_question, while related to the main question, does not focus specifically on the phrase that was removed, making it less relevant. 
2. The second sub_question, regarding leap day dates, introduces an external timeframe which does not help directly answer the user's question. 
3. The third sub_question about the significance of leap day includes broader concepts and lacks clarity in relation to the main question which focuses on a specific joke. 
Additionally, there are issues with singularity as the questions are not sufficiently focused.

Validation Result: Failed
Justification: The second sub_question is an external assumption since it assumes specific knowledge regarding the date of removal without being specified in the user's question. It also fails to explore a narrower aspect of the main question. The third sub_question appears too broad and does not specifically relate to the user's query regarding a specific event.

ResultValidator-Questioner (to chat_manager):

Validation Result: Failed
Justification: The proposed sub_questions do not satisfy all of the specified validation criteria. For instance, the first sub_question assumes the existence of a joke without specifying the exact joke being asked in the user question, and it is thus not sufficiently relevant. The second sub_question is vague, as it does not specify which page or context it is referring to, and it introduces the idea of jokes in a general context rather than specifically concerning 'Dragon'. The third sub_question does not target the main inquiry about a specific joke and diverges significantly from the user’s original focus.
