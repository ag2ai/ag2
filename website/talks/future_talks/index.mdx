## Mosaia - The AI community’s platform for creating, sharing and deploying AI agents in a serverless cloud environment - Nov 28, 2024

### Speakers: Aaron Wong-Ellis

### Biography of the speakers:

Aaron Wong-Ellis is the co-founder and CTO at Mosaia. His several years of experience in the field of AI, IOT and building enterprise platforms has equipped him with the right skill set to build Mosaia. Aaron has worked as an application architect and engineer for small startups and large Fortune 100 companies like AWS. His recent work focuses on developing a platform for creating, sharing and running LLM agents in a scalable serverless cloud infrastructure.

### Abstract:

Running multiple AI agents reliably on the cloud, can encounter numerous challenges. At Mosaia we faced the challenges head on and created a way to do this in a scalable serverless cloud environment. Allowing people to run their agents with little to no code at all. Just write up your prompts and construct your groups of agents through a browser based UI. Being able to do this, opened up many possibilities to construct and share agents with others to use on Mosaia or run locally using Autogen. Mosaia was created as a platform to not only run agents but allow prompt engineers to host and share these agents with others. Fostering a community of collaboration and creativity around building AI agents.

### Abstract:

Current LLM-based orchestration tools often lack support for multi-agent interactions, are restricted to basic communication patterns, or only provide information after the entire workflow has completed. Waldiez is an open-source workflow tool that lets you orchestrate your LLM-agents using drag-and-drop and develop complex agentic applications.  It is a low-code tool that assists you design and visualize your multi-agent workflow in jupyter lab as a plugin. Wadiez runs over AG2 supporting all the communication patterns (e.g., sequential, nested and group chat), supporting several LLM-based services offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA NIM, local hosted models and several others.  In this talk, we’ll dive into the powerful features of Wadiez, demonstrating its capabilities through real-world use cases. Join us as we explore how Wadiez can streamline complex workflows and enhance multi-agent interactions, showcasing exactly what sets it apart from other LLM-based orchestration tools.
