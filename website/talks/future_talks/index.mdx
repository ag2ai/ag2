## Mosaia - The AI community’s platform for creating, sharing and deploying AI agents in a serverless cloud environment - Nov 28, 2024

### Speakers: Aaron Wong-Ellis

### Biography of the speakers:

Aaron Wong-Ellis is the co-founder and CTO at Mosaia. His several years of experience in the field of AI, IOT and building enterprise platforms has equipped him with the right skill set to build Mosaia. Aaron has worked as an application architect and engineer for small startups and large Fortune 100 companies like AWS. His recent work focuses on developing a platform for creating, sharing and running LLM agents in a scalable serverless cloud infrastructure.

### Abstract:

Running multiple AI agents reliably on the cloud, can encounter numerous challenges. At Mosaia we faced the challenges head on and created a way to do this in a scalable serverless cloud environment. Allowing people to run their agents with little to no code at all. Just write up your prompts and construct your groups of agents through a browser based UI. Being able to do this, opened up many possibilities to construct and share agents with others to use on Mosaia or run locally using Autogen. Mosaia was created as a platform to not only run agents but allow prompt engineers to host and share these agents with others. Fostering a community of collaboration and creativity around building AI agents.

## Make AI Agents Collaborate: Drag, Drop, and Orchestrate with Waldiez - Dec 9, 2024

### Speakers: Panagiotis Kasnesis

### Biography of the speakers:

Panagiotis Kasnesis holds a Ph.D degree in computer science from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA. He received his diploma degree in chemical engineering and his M.Sc. in techno-economic systems from NTUA, in 2008 and 2013 respectively. His research interests include Machine/Deep learning, Multi-Agent Systems and IoT, while he has published more than 50 scientific articles in international journals/conferences in these fields. He is founder and CEO of Waldiez (https://waldiez.io/), co-founder and CTO of ThinGenious and serves as a senior researcher at University of West Attica. Moreover, he is a lecturer at the MSc program “Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning” (https://aidl.uniwa.gr/) and is certified as University Ambassador, by NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI), in the tasks of Building Transformer-Based NLP Applications, and Rapid Application Development Using LLMs.

### Abstract:

Current LLM-based orchestration tools often lack support for multi-agent interactions, are restricted to basic communication patterns, or only provide information after the entire workflow has completed. Waldiez is an open-source workflow tool that lets you orchestrate your LLM-agents using drag-and-drop and develop complex agentic applications.  It is a low-code tool that assists you design and visualize your multi-agent workflow in jupyter lab as a plugin. Wadiez runs over AG2 supporting all the communication patterns (e.g., sequential, nested and group chat), supporting several LLM-based services offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA NIM, local hosted models and several others.  In this talk, we’ll dive into the powerful features of Wadiez, demonstrating its capabilities through real-world use cases. Join us as we explore how Wadiez can streamline complex workflows and enhance multi-agent interactions, showcasing exactly what sets it apart from other LLM-based orchestration tools.

## Investigating Group Decision-Making Mechanism in Decentralized Multi-Agent Collaboration - Nov 25

### Speakers: Young-Min Cho

### Biography of the speakers:

Young-Min Cho (known as Jeffrey) is a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence. As a member of Penn NLP, WWBP, and CSL, he is advised by Dr. Lyle Ungar and Dr. Sharath Chandra Guntuku. His research focuses on controlling conversations in Multi-Agent Systems and Conversational Agents, with an emphasis on achieving consensus in agent collaboration, managing conversational behavior traits, and generating effective clarifying questions. He is also exploring social and psychological insights through language-based assessments, including applications such as mental health chatbots and analyses of cultural differences in emotional expressions.

### Abstract:

This study investigates the efficacy of Multi-Agent Systems in eliciting cross-agent communication and enhancing collective intelligence through group decision-making in a decentralized setting. Unlike centralized mechanisms, where a fixed hierarchy governs social choice, decentralized group decision-making allows agents to engage in joint deliberation. Our research focuses on the dynamics of communication and decision-making within various social choice methods. By applying different voting rules in various environments, we find that moderate decision flexibility yields better outcomes. Additionally, exploring the linguistic features of agent-to-agent conversations reveals indicators of effective collaboration, offering insights into communication patterns that facilitate or hinder collaboration. Finally, we propose various methods for determining the optimal stopping point in multi-agent collaborations based on linguistic cues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how decentralized decision-making and group conversation shape multi-agent collaboration, with implications for the design of more effective MAS environments.
