::tip
Want an agent that can do this for you? See our walk-through on DocumentAgent.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique to improve LLM-generated responses by giving it additional knowledge.

There are a number of ways to incorporate RAG into your AG2 workflow and agents:
- Use a reference agent, DocumentAgent
- Add RAG capabilities to an agent
- Add RAG tools to an agent
- Incorporate context into an agent's system message (manually and automatically)

## 1. DocumentAgent

If you have documents or web pages that you need to query, use our reference agent, [DocumentAgent](documentagent.md).

DocumentAgent takes the hassle out of loading, parsing, storing, and querying knowledge.
