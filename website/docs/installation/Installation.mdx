## Create a virtual environment (optional)

When installing AutoGen locally, we recommend using a virtual environment for the installation. This will ensure that the dependencies for AutoGen are isolated from the rest of your system.

  <Tab title="venv" default>
    <p>Create and activate:</p>
    
      ```
      python3 -m venv autogen
      source autogen/bin/activate
      ```
    
    <p>To deactivate later, run:</p>
    ```
    deactivate
    ```

    if you have not already.
  </p>
  <p>Create and activate:</p>

```
conda create -n autogen python=3.10
conda activate autogen
```

  <p>To deactivate later, run:</p>
  ```python
  conda deactivate

    <p>Create and active:</p>

      ```
      poetry init
      poetry shell

      poetry add autogen
      ```

    <p>To deactivate later, run:</p>

## Install AutoGen

AutoGen requires **Python version >= 3.8, < 3.14**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install autogen
```

  <Info> `openai>=1` is required. </Info>

## Install Docker for Code Execution

We recommend using Docker for code execution.
To install Docker, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

A simple example of how to use Docker for code execution is shown below:

```
from pathlib import Path
from autogen import UserProxyAgent
from autogen.coding import DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor

work_dir = Path("coding")
work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

with DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir) as code_executor:
    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
        name="user_proxy",
        code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor},
    )
```

To learn more about code executors, see the [code executors tutorial](/docs/tutorial/code-executors).

You might have seen a different way of defining the executors without creating the
executor object, please refer to FAQ for this [legacy code executor](/docs/FAQ#legacy-code-executor).
