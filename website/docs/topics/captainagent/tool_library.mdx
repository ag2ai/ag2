# Tool Library
In CaptainAgent, tools are in the form of python functions. The agents can write code to import functions and call them according to their needs. This can significantly enhance the functionality and capabilities of the agents.

We provide a list of tools that comes with the release of CaptainAgent.

## Using the Built-in Tool Library
### Install dependencies
First install the requirements for running tools via pip. The requirements file is located in `autogen/agentchat/contrib/captainagent/tools/requirements.txt`.

### Subscribe to Certain APIs
To use the provided built-in tools, it is required to obtain a Bing Search API key and RapidAPI key.
For Bing API, you can read more about how to get an API on the [Bing Web Search API](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api) page.
For RapidAPI, you can [sign up](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up) and subscribe to these two links([link1](https://rapidapi.com/solid-api-solid-api-default/api/youtube-transcript3), [link2](https://rapidapi.com/420vijay47/api/youtube-mp3-downloader2)).
These two apis have free billing options and there is no need to worry about extra costs for small scale runs.

Whenever you run the tool-related code, remember to export the api keys to system variables.
```bash
export BING_API_KEY=""
export RAPID_API_KEY=""
```
or
```python
import os
os.environ["BING_API_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["RAPID_API_KEY"] = ""
```

Then you are good to go. Feel free to try out the examples provided in the CaptainAgent notebook.

## What is in the Tool Library
The tool library consists of three types of tools: math, data_analysis and information_retrieval. Its folder layout is as follows. Each 'py' file implements a tool.

```
tools
├── README.md
├── data_analysis
│   ├── calculate_correlation.py
│   └── ...
├── information_retrieval
│   ├── arxiv_download.py
│   ├── arxiv_search.py
│   └── ...
├── math
│   ├── calculate_circle_area_from_diameter.py
│   └── ...
└── tool_description.tsv
```

Tools can be imported from `tools/{category}/{tool_name}.py` with exactly the same tool name.
`tool_description.tsv` contains descriptions of tools for retrieval.

## How Tool Library works
When an agent's description is provided, a retriever will retrieve `top_k` tool candidates from the library based on the semantic
similarity between agent description and tool description. The tool description is same as that in `tool_description.tsv`.

After candidates are retrieved, the agent's system message will be updated with the tool candidates' information and how to call the tools.
A user proxy with the ability to execute the code will be added to the nested chat. Under the hood, this is achieved by leveraging the
[User Defined Functions](/docs/topics/code-execution/user-defined-functions) feature. A `LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor` equipped with all the functions serves as
code executor for the user proxy.
