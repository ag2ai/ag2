    "# Swarm Ochestration\n",
    "\n",
    "With AG2, you can initiate a Swarm Chat similar to OpenAI's [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm). In this orchestration, there are two main features:\n",
    "- **Headoffs**: Agents can transfer control to another agent via function calls, enabling smooth transitions within workflows.\n",
    "- **Context Variables**: Agents can dynamically update shared variables through function calls, maintaining context and adaptability throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of sending a task to a sinlge LLM agent, you can send it to a swarm of agents. Each agent in the swarm can decide whether to handoff the task to another agent. \n",
    "When the last active agent's response is only a string (it doesn't suggest tool call or handoff), the chat will be terminated."

    "We now introduce the main components that need to be used to create a swarm chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create `SwarmAgent`\n",
    "All the agents passed to the swarm chat should be instances of this class. `SwarmAgent` is very similar to `AssistantAgent`, but it has some additional features to support function registration and handoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "When creating a `SwarmAgent`, you can pass in a list of functions. These functions will be converted to schemas to be passed to the LLMs, and you don't need to worry about registering the functions for execution. You can also pass back a `SwarmResult` class, where you can return a value, the next agent to call and update context variables at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes for creating the function calls**\n",
    "- For input arguments, you must define the type of the argument, otherwise the registration will fail (e.g. `arg_name: str`). \n",
    "- If your function requires access or modification of the context variables, you must pass in `context_variables: dict` as one argument. This argument will not be visible to the LLM (removed when registering the function schema). But when being called, the global context variables will be passed in by the swarm chat.\n",
    "- The docstring of the function will be used as the prompt. So make sure to write a clear description.\n",
    "- The function name will be used as the tool name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func_1(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Doc String\"\"\"\n",
    "    return \"response\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def transfer_to_some_agent() -> SwarmAgent:\n",
    "    return SwarmAgent(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "def func_3(context_variables: dict, arg2: str) -> SwarmResult:\n",
    "    # ... update context variables\n",
    "    context_variables[\"key\"] = \"value\"\n",
    "    return SwarmResult(value=\"value\", agent=<swarmagent object>, context_variables=context_variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "SwarmAgent(\n",
    "    ..., # same arguments as AssistantAgent\n",
    "    functions=[func_1, transfer_to_some_agent, func_3] # a new parameter that allows passing a list of functions\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Registering Handoffs\n",
    "While you can create an function to decide what next agent to call, we provide a quick way to register the handoff use `ON_CONDITION`. We will craft this transition function and add it to the LLM config directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "agent_2 = SwarmAgent(...)\n",
    "agent_3 = SwarmAgent(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Register the handoff\n",
    "agent_1 = SwarmAgent(...)\n",
    "agent_1.handoff(hand_to=[ON_CONDITION(agent_2, \"condition_1\"), ON_CONDITION(agent_3, \"condition_2\")])\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is equivalent to:\n",
    "def transfer_to_agent_2():\n",
    "    \"\"\"condition_1\"\"\"\n",
    "    return agent_2\n",
    "\n",
    "def transfer_to_agent_3():\n",
    "    \"\"\"condition_1\"\"\"\n",
    "    return agent_3\n",
    "    \n",
    "agent_1 = SwarmAgent(..., functions=[transfer_to_agent_2, transfer_to_agent_3])\n",
    "# You can also use agent_1.add_functions to add more functions after initialization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### AFTER_WORK\n",
    "\n",
    "When the last active agent's response doesn't suggest a tool call or handoff, the chat will terminate by default. However, you can register an `AFTER_WORK` handoff to define a fallback agent if you don't want the chat to end at this agent. At the swarm chat level, you also pass in an `AFTER_WORK` handoff to define the fallback mechanism for the entire chat.\n",
    "If this parameter is set for both the agent and the chat, we will prioritize the agent's setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides fallback to an agent, we provide 3 `AfterWorkOption`:\n",
    "- `TERMINATE`: Terminate the chat\n",
    "- `STAY`: Stay at the current agent\n",
    "- `REVERT_TO_USER`: Revert to the user agent. Only if an user agent is passed in when initializing. (See below for more details)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "agent_1 = SwarmAgent(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Register the handoff\n",
    "agent_1.handoff(hand_to=[\n",
    "    ON_CONDITION(...), \n",
    "    ON_CONDITION(...),\n",
    "    AFTER_WORK(agent_4) # Fallback to agent_4 if no handoff is suggested\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "agent_2.handoff(hand_to=[AFTER_WORK(TERMINATE)]) # Terminate the chat if no handoff is suggested\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialize SwarmChat with `initiate_swarm_chat`\n",
    "\n",
    "After a set of swarm agents are created, you can initiate a swarm chat by calling `initiate_swarm_chat`.\n",
