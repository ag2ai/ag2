title: Communication Agents
---

Bring your social platforms into your AG2 workflow with `DiscordAgent`, `SlackAgent`, and `TelegramAgent`.

Available as standalone agents or as tools that you can add to your own agents.

:::note
These tools are currently in our `experimental` namespace, indicating that we have tested the functionality but they have not been confirmed for use in production. Please use them with that in mind and we appreciate any feedback on them.

If you do find any bugs please [log an issue](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/issues) in the AG2 repository. If you would like to add more tools or functionality, we would love your [contribution](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/contributor-guide/contributing).

## Installation

Install AG2 with the necessary extra for the platform(s) you need.

```bash
pip install ag2[commsagent-discord]
```
```bash
pip install ag2[commsagent-slack]
```
```bash
pip install ag2[commsagent-telegram]
```

## Platform configuration

Each agent/tool is configured for a specific channel/group/bot. This configuration is applied when you create the agent/tool.

Discord, Slack, and Telegram all have their own authentication and channel/group/bot identifiers. See [this Notebook](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/tools_commsplatforms) for more guidance on establishing those authentication details and identifiers.

## Use as Standalone Agents

![Communication Agents and their Tools](./assets/commsagents_tools.png)

The three communication agents have two in-built tools for sending and retrieving messages, respectively. The agents will automatically determine which tool(s) to call based on the conversation (you can influence this by adjusting their system message).

As the agents are based on ConversableAgent you can use them in any conversation pattern in AG2.

An important component of the new agents (as opposed to just using their tools) is that the platform's messaging requirements will be appended to their system message.

They cover aspects like maximum message length, preferred format (e.g. Markdown), and provide tips like using emojis.

| Agent | System Message guidance |
| --- | --- |
| DiscordAgent | 2,000 character limit, Markdown, bold/italic/code, use emojis |
| SlackAgent | 40,000 character limit, Markdown, bold/italic/code, emojis, notification formats |
| TelegramAgent | 4,096 character limit, HTML, mentions and emojis |

These are enabled by default, but you can turn these off by setting `has_writing_instructions` to `False` when creating the agent.

### Code examples

See our [blog post](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/tools_browser_use) and [video TODO]() for a demonstration of using the communication agents.

For supporting guidance on establishing the relevant authentication tokens and IDs, see [this Notebook](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/tools_commsplatforms).

## Use as Tools

You can create and add any of the available communication tools to your agents, empowering your agents with communication abilities.

### Code examples

See [this Notebook](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/tools_commsplatforms) for examples of using the communication tools and guidance on establishing the relevant authentication tokens and IDs.

## Capabilities

The send functionality is consistent across agents/send tools, they take a message and post it to the configured channel/group/bot. If a message is longer than the platforms permitted message length, the tool will split the message into multiple messages.

The common retrieve functionality includes:
- Retrieve the latest X messages from a channel/group/bot.
- Retrieve messages since a given date.
- Retrieve messages since a given message ID.
- Retrieve a message given its ID.

The Telegram retrieve tool also has the ability to retrieve messages using a search string (and this can be done in combination with the retrieval options above).

# Tool execution

In AG2 the tool execution is typically handled by a separate agent that will follow the agent in the conversation (unless its an agent in a swarm whereby tools are executed automatically). So, you will need to register the tools with another agent for execution.
