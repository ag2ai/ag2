# Latest Updates

## Message Format Standardization (PR #2081)

### Overview
The agent messaging API has been standardized to use a consistent `list[dict[str, Any]]` format internally, while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing code.

### What Changed
- `send()` and `receive()` methods now consistently work with lists of message dictionaries
- All message formats (string, dict, list) are automatically normalized to the standard format
- Hooks now receive normalized dict messages (never strings)

### Backward Compatibility
**No changes required to your existing code!** All previous message formats continue to work:

```python
# All of these still work
agent.send("Hello", recipient)                          # String
agent.send({"content": "Hello"}, recipient)            # Single dict
agent.send([{"content": "Hello"}], recipient)          # List of dicts
```

### Best Practices for New Code

#### Use Explicit List Format for Multiple Messages
When sending multiple messages at once, use the list format:

```python
# ✅ Recommended: Batch multiple messages
agent.send([
    {"content": "First message", "role": "user"},
    {"content": "Second message", "role": "user"}
], recipient)
```

#### Single Messages: Use What's Most Readable
For single messages, all formats are equally efficient:

```python
# ✅ All equally good for single messages
agent.send("Simple text message", recipient)
agent.send({"content": "Message with metadata", "name": "tool_result"}, recipient)
agent.send([{"content": "Explicit list format"}], recipient)
```

#### Performance Considerations
- **Single messages**: All formats have similar performance (automatic normalization is fast)
- **Multiple messages**: Use list format to send them in one call rather than looping
- **Hooks**: Called once per message in the list, so batching reduces hook overhead

```python
# ❌ Less efficient: Multiple sends
for msg in messages:
    agent.send(msg, recipient)

# ✅ More efficient: Single batch send
agent.send(messages, recipient)
```

### Hook Authors: Important Changes

If you've written custom hooks, note these changes:

#### Hook Input Format
Hooks registered for `"process_message_before_send"` now **always receive dict messages**:

```python
def my_hook(sender, message, recipient, silent):
    # message is ALWAYS a dict (never a string)
    assert isinstance(message, dict)

    # Modify the message
    message["custom_field"] = "value"

    # MUST return a dict
    return message  # ✅ Correct
    # return None   # ❌ Raises TypeError
    # return "text" # ❌ Raises TypeError
```

#### Hook Return Contract
- **Must return**: `dict[str, Any]`
- **Cannot return**: `None`, `str`, or `list`
- **Validation**: The framework validates return types and raises `TypeError` if violated

#### Hook Processing of Lists
When an agent sends a list of messages, your hook is called **once per message**:

```python
# If agent sends 3 messages
agent.send([msg1, msg2, msg3], recipient)

# Your hook is called 3 times:
# 1. my_hook(..., message=msg1, ...)
# 2. my_hook(..., message=msg2, ...)
# 3. my_hook(..., message=msg3, ...)
```
