[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s Responses API is a significant evolution from the Chat Completions and Assistants APIs, offering support for both stateless interactions and structured, stateful conversations.

Additionally, it includes built-in tools for web search, file search, and computer use. The robust multimodal capabilities of the API also set it apart and will be utilized in our initial support for this API. [See their website for further details](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses).

<Tip>
With the new OpenAI V2 client (api_type: "openai_v2") in AG2/autogen, you get full support for group chat, run interfaces, and advanced multimodal capabilities. This client is recommended for all new usage, including multi-agent and pattern-based chats. See the [notebook examples](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/Notebooks/?tags=responses) for current up-to-date usage patterns.
</Tip>

## Installation

``` bash
pip install ag2[openai]
```

<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `ag2`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen[openai]
```
or
```bash
pip install -U ag2[openai]
```
as `autogen` and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.

## LLM Configurations

See the [LLM Configuration](/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/llm-configuration) for further details on setting and creating an LLM configuration.

The below examples show how to use the OpenAI client classes for the Responses API. For legacy-style access, use `api_type: "responses"`; for full feature support (including group chat, `run`, vision, and future-proof multimodal interaction), use `api_type: "openai_v2"`.

**Recommended (V2 client, full feature support):**

```python
[
    {
        "api_type": "openai_v2", # recommended: full support for group/run/multimodal
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "api_key": "your OpenAI Key goes here",

        # Optional: vision, advanced features, and future content handled automatically
    },
]
```

**Legacy Responses API (basic two-agent chat):**

```python
[
    {
        "api_type": "responses", # use OpenAI Responses API
        "model": "gpt-5",
        "api_key": "your OpenAI Key goes here",

        # Optional: use image_generation and web_search built-in tools
        # See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision?api-mode=responses
        "built_in_tools": ["image_generation", "web_search"],
    }
]
```

As an alternative to the `api_key` key and value in the config, you can set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI key.

Linux/Mac:
``` bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

Windows:
``` bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

__Note__: The OpenAI V2 client (api_type: "openai_v2") is now fully integrated with group chat and `run` APIs, as well as advanced multimodal/vision. See the [notebook](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/agentchat_openai_v2_client_image) for example workflows and migration tips.
