Our financial compliance system is now quite powerful - it can process transactions, check for duplicates, flag suspicious activities, and generate summary reports. But there's still one limitation: we can't guarantee the exact format of the summary reports.
What if we need to:

- Ensure reports follow a precise, consistent structure for database storage?
- Generate compliance data that must be sent to regulatory systems in a specific format?
- Create JSON outputs that integrate with internal dashboards and monitoring tools?
- Validate that all required fields are present before processing?
