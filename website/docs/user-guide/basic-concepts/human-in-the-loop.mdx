title: Human in the loop
---

As you build your AG2 workflows, you may want to provide feedback or instructions to your agents. To do so, you can create *human in the loop* agents using the ConversableAgent and setting the `human_input_mode` to `ALWAYS`.

Let's start to build a more useful scenario, a classroom lesson planner, and create our human agent.

import Example from "/snippets/python-examples/humanintheloop.mdx";

<Example/>

1. Create our human-in-the-loop agent by setting its `human_input_mode`, and no `llm_config` is required.

2. Our `the_human` agent starts a conversation by sending a message to `lesson_planner`. An agent's `initiate_chat` method is used to start a conversation between two agents.

This creates a conversation between you and the lesson planner agent.
