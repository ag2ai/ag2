If you're wanting to develop new agents, agent capabilities, or understand the flow of an AG2 workflow, this is the right section for you.

<Tip>
This section involves diving into AG2's source code, if that doesn't sound like what you are after, check out our Basic and Advanced concept sections under [User Guide](/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/installing-ag2).
</Tip>

AG2's agent workflow and the `ConversableAgent` class are built on a layered mixin architecture: core conversational logic, reply logic, function and tool execution, code execution, hooks (for extensibility/capabilities), messaging infrastructure, and LLM/utility integration are all implemented as modular components ("mixins"). If you're tracing the flow or adding capabilities, note that behaviors like `generate_reply`, receiving/sending messages, running code, function/tool handling, and context hooks may be defined or extended across these composable modules.

Sections:

1. Chat workflow with [initiate_chat](/docs/contributor-guide/how-ag2-works/initiate-chat)

2. How ConversableAgent generates its reply with [generate_reply](/docs/contributor-guide/how-ag2-works/generate-reply)
   (Includes trigger logic, reply handler registration, code execution, tool/function pipeline, and hooks.)

3. How to update agent and message state using [hooks](/docs/contributor-guide/how-ag2-works/hooks)
    (Includes details on registering and processing state before/after replies.)
