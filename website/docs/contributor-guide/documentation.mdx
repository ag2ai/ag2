## Building Documentation Locally

You can build and serve the documentation locally by following these steps:

<Tip>
We recommended using a virtual environment for your project to keep your packages contained. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="_blank">venv</a>.
</Tip>

### Prerequisites

1.  Install Quarto:
    - Visit the Quarto download <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/download/" target="_blank">page</a>.
    - Navigate to the Pre-release tab and download the latest version
    - Ensure you install version `1.5.23` or higher.

### Installation

From the project root directory, install the necessary Python packages:

```console
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```

### Building and Serving the Documentation

**Note:** The previously available scripts for building and serving documentation (such as `./scripts/docs_build_mkdocs.sh`, `./scripts/docs_serve_mkdocs.sh`, `./scripts/docs_build.sh`, and `./scripts/docs_serve.sh`) have been removed from the codebase. Please refer to the project README or reach out to the maintainers for the current workflow for building and serving documentation locally.

## Build with Dev Containers

If you prefer to use a containerized development environment, you can build and test the documentation using Dev Containers.

### Setting up Dev Containers

- Install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">VSCode</a> if you haven't already.
- Open the project in VSCode.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.

This will open the project in a Dev Container with all the required dependencies pre-installed.

### Building and serving in the container

Once your project is open in the Dev Container:

- Open a terminal in VSCode and install the project with docs dependencies:

    ```console
    pip install -e ".[docs]"
    ```

- Build and serve the documentation using the currently recommended workflow. (The scripts referenced previously may no longer be available; consult project documentation or maintainers for up-to-date instructions.)

The documentation will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, depending on the serving approach used.

## Handling updates or changes

For any changes to be reflected in the documentation, you will need to:

- Stop the running server (if applicable)
- Re-run the build process (refer to up-to-date project documentation for this step)
- Start the server again (if applicable)

<Note>

When switching branches or making major changes to the documentation structure, you might occasionally notice deleted files still appearing or changes not showing up properly. This happens due to cached build files. The previous solution required running build commands with the `--force` flag using project scripts. As those scripts have been removed, please consult the current project documentation or maintainers for instructions on how to clear caches or fully rebuild documentation.

</Note>

## Adding Notebooks to the Website

When you want to add a new Jupyter notebook and have it rendered in the documentation, you need to follow specific guidelines to ensure proper integration with the website.

Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/contributing.md#how-to-get-a-notebook-displayed-on-the-website" target="_blank">this</a> guideline for more details.

## Before Making a Pull Request

To maintain code quality and consistency, we use pre-commit hooks that automatically run checks like linting, formatting, and other validations before each commit. It’s important to have these properly set up in your development environment before you start committing changes.

If you skip this setup, your pull request’s CI checks may fail, and you'll need to fix issues and update your PR later — so it's highly recommended to get everything configured upfront.

<Note>
For more information on setting up the development environment, refer to this [page](/docs/contributor-guide/setup-development-environment/).
</Note>

### Setting up Pre-commit Hooks

From the project root, run the following command to install the development dependencies and set up the pre-commit hooks:

```console
pip install -e ".[dev]" && pre-commit install
```
This ensures that every time you run git commit, a **series of checks will automatically be executed**.
