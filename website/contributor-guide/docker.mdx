## Setting up LLM Keys

If you are contributing to the AG2 project, you will need an LLM key depending on the submodule you are working on.

If you are working on OpenAI related code, you need to setup an environment variable called `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` in JSON format. Following is an example of the `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` environment variable:

```bash
export OAI_CONFIG_LIST='[{"model": "gpt-4o","api_key": "<your_api_key>","tags": ["gpt-4o", "tool", "vision"]},{"model": "gpt-4o-mini","api_key": "<your_api_key>","tags": ["gpt-4o-mini", "tool", "vision"]}]'
```

You need to add a separate entry for each OpenAI model you are using.

If you are working on other LLMs such as Gemini, Anthropic, Together, etc., you need to setup an environment variable for the respective LLM's key. Following is an example of the environment variable for Gemini:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="<your_api_key>"
```

## Setting up the Development Environment

To contribute to the AG2 project, AG2 provides three different method to setup the development environment:

### Developing with Devcontainers

1. Setup the necessary LLM keys as mentioned above in your terminal.
2. Clone the AG2 repository and cd into the repository.
3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code by running the following command from the root of the repository:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```
4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
5. Select the desired python environment and wait for the container to build.
6. Once the container is built, you can start developing AG2.

### Developing with Codespaces

The provided devcontainer files can be used with GitHub Codespaces. To use the devcontainer with GitHub Codespaces, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AG2 repository on GitHub and fork the repository.
2. Navigate to Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Codespaces.
3. Add the necessary LLM keys as mentioned above by clicking on the `New repository secret` button.
4. Navigate back to the forked repository.
5. Click on the `Code` button and select `Open with Codespaces`.
6. Once the container is built, you can start developing AG2.

### Developing with Virtual Environment

1. Setup the necessary LLM keys as mentioned above in your terminal.
2. Fork the AG2 repository and clone the forked repository.
3. Create a virtual environment by running the following command from the root of the repository:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```
6. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start developing AG2.
