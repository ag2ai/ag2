## Introduction

Previously, in our [Cross-Framework LLM Tool Integration](/blog/2024-12-20-Tools-interoperability) guide, we combined tools from frameworks like **LangChain**, **CrewAI**, and **PydanticAI** to enhance AG2.

Now, we’re taking AG2 even further by integrating [`Browser Use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) and [`Crawl4AI`](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai), enabling agents to navigate websites, extract dynamic content, and interact with web pages. This unlocks new possibilities for automated data collection, web automation, and more.
![Browser Use Example](/docs/use-cases/reference-agents/assets/websurferagent_animated.gif)

## `Browser Use` Integration

### Installation

To get started with the `browser-use` integration in AG2, follow these steps:

1. Install AG2 with the `browser-use` extra:
   ```bash
   pip install ag2[browser-use]
   ````
2. Set up Playwright:

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

You're all set! Now you can start using browsing features in AG2.

### Imports

```python
import os

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.tools.experimental import BrowserUseTool
```

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.

- `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model and API key.
- `UserProxyAgent` simulates user inputs without requiring actual human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
- `AssistantAgent` represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM settings.

```python
config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]

llm_config = {
    "config_list": config_list,
}

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")
assistant = AssistantAgent(name="assistant", llm_config=llm_config)
```

### Integrating Web Browsing with BrowserUseTool


The `BrowserUseTool` llows agents to interact with web pages—navigating, searching, and extracting information.

To see the agent's activity in real-time, set `headless` to `False` in the `browser_config`. If `True`, the browser runs in the background.

```python
browser_use_tool = BrowserUseTool(
    llm_config=llm_config,
    browser_config={"headless": False},
)

browser_use_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)
browser_use_tool.register_for_llm(assistant)
```

### Initiate Chat

For Jupyter notebooks, install `nest_asyncio` to enable nested event loops:

```bash
pip install nest_asyncio
```

Now, let’s run a task where the assistant searches Reddit for “AG2,” clicks the first post, and retrieves the first comment.

```python
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()

result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    recipient=assistant,
    message="Go to Reddit, search for 'ag2' in the search bar, click on the first post and return the first comment.",
    max_turns=2,
)
```

```console
user_proxy (to assistant):

Go to Reddit, search for 'ag2' in the search bar, click on the first post and return the first comment.
