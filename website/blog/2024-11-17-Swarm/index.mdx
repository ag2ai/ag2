AutoGen Groupchat now supports a new speaker selection method, `swarm`, which allows quick implementation of the swarm orchestration from OpenAI's [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) framework.

Here are two key features of the `swarm` speaker selection method:
- **Headoffs**: Agents can transfer control to another agent via function calls, enabling smooth transitions within workflows.
- **Context Variables**: Agents can dynamically update shared variables through function calls, maintaining context and adaptability throughout the process.


## Getting Started

The `swarm` speaker selection method needs to be used in conjunction with `SwarmAgent` and `SwarmResult` classes. Use the `initialize_swarm_chat` to get a swarm reply.

```python
from autogen.agentchat.swarm.swarm_agent import SwarmAgent, SwarmResult, initialize_swarm_chat
```
