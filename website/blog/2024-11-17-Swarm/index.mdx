AG2 now provides an implementation of the swarm orchestration from OpenAI's [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) framework with some additional features.

*Background*: the swarm orchestration is a multi-agent collaboration where agents execute tasks and are responsible for handing-off to other agents.

Here are two key features of the swarm orchestration:
- **Hand offs**: Agents can transfer control to another agent, enabling smooth and direct transitions within workflows.
- **Context Variables**: Agents can dynamically update a shared dictionary through function calls, maintaining context and adaptability throughout the process.

In addition to the OpenAI implementation, AG2 provides:
- **Built-in human-in-the-loop**: Adding a user agent (UserProxyAgent) to your swarm will allow swarm agents to transition back to the user. Provides a means to clarify and confirm questions without breaking out of the swarm.
- **Fall-back agent**: The ability to automatically transition to a nominated swarm agent when an agent has completed their task.

## Getting Started

To create a swarm:
1. Define the functions that can be used by your `SwarmAgent`'s.
2. Create your `SwarmAgent`s (which derive from `ConversableAgent`).
3. For each agent, specify the hand-offs (transitions to another agent) and what to do when they have finished their work (termed *After Work*).

UP TO HERE

The `swarm` speaker selection method needs to be used in conjunction with `SwarmAgent` and `SwarmResult` classes. Use the `initialize_swarm_chat` to get a swarm reply.

```python
from autogen.agentchat.swarm.swarm_agent import SwarmAgent, SwarmResult, initialize_swarm_chat
```
