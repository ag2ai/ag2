**TL;DR**
- We introduce CaptainAgent, an agent equipped with the capability to adaptively assemble a team of agents through retrieval-selection-generation process to handle complex tasks via the [`nested chat`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/tutorial/conversation-patterns#nested-chats) conversation pattern in AG2.
- CaptainAgent supports all types of `ConversableAgents` implemented in Autogen.

# Introduction

Given an ad-hoc task, dynamically assembling a group of agents capable of effectively solving the problem is a complex challenge. In many cases, we manually design and select the agents involved. In this blog, we introduce **CaptainAgent**, an intelligent agent that can autonomously assemble a team of agents tailored to meet diverse and complex task requirements.
We design a two-step workflow for CaptainAgent to build a high quality team and solve the problem:
- (**Step 1**) CaptainAgent will first break down the task, recommend several roles needed for each subtask, and then create a team of agents accordingly. Each agent in the team is either generated from scratch or retrieved and selected from an agent library if provided. Each of them will also be equipped with predefined tools retrieved from a tool library if provided.

- (**Step 2**) this team of agents will attempt to solve the subtask via conversation with the free-form tool using. Once it's done, a reflector LLM will provide CaptainAgent with a reflection report for it to decide whether to adjust the team or subtask instruction or to terminate and output the results.

We also provide an agent library and a tool library for CaptainAgent to choose from when building the team. In the following section, we demonstrate how to use CaptainAgent with or without the provided library.

# Using CaptainAgent without libraries
CaptainAgent can serve as a drop-in replacement for the general AssistantAgent. To use CaptainAgent, we need to instantiate a CaptainAgent and a UserProxy, then start a chat. To do that we just need to configure to the settings of group chat instantiated by CaptainAgent.
Without the agent library and tool library, CaptainAgent will automatically generate a set of agents into a group chat.

```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captain_agent import CaptainAgent

general_llm_config = {
    "temperature": 0,
    "config_list": autogen.config_list_from_json("OAI_CONFIG_LIST", filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4-1106-preview"]}),
}

nested_mode_config = {
    "autobuild_init_config": {
        "config_file_or_env": "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
        "builder_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
        "agent_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
    },
    # this is used to configure the autobuild building process
    "autobuild_build_config": {
        "default_llm_config": {"temperature": 1, "top_p": 0.95},
        "code_execution_config": {"timeout": 300, "work_dir": "groupchat", "last_n_messages": 1},
        "coding": True,
    },
    "group_chat_config": {"max_round": 15},
    "group_chat_llm_config": general_llm_config.copy(),
    "max_turns": 3,
}

## build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(
    name="captain_agent",
    llm_config=general_llm_config,
    nested_mode_config=nested_mode_config,
)
user_proxy = CaptainUserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
)
query = "Let's play game of 24. Given 4 numbers, you need to use +, -, *, / to get 24. The numbers are 2, 2, 7, 12."
result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(captain_agent, message=query)
```

# Using CaptainAgent with libraries
To use CaptainAgent with libraries, we just need to specify the path to the tool library and agent library. The two libraries are independent, so you can choose to use one of the libraries or both.
The tool library we provide requires subscribing to specific apis, please refer to the [docs](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/topics/captainagent) for details. The following example does not necessarily requires tool usage.

```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captain_agent import CaptainAgent

general_llm_config = {
    "temperature": 0,
    "config_list": autogen.config_list_from_json("OAI_CONFIG_LIST", filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4-1106-preview"]}),
}

nested_mode_config = {
    "autobuild_init_config": {
        "config_file_or_env": "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
        "builder_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
        "agent_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
    },
    # this is used to configure the autobuild building process
    "autobuild_build_config": {
        "default_llm_config": {"temperature": 1, "top_p": 0.95},
        "code_execution_config": {"timeout": 300, "work_dir": "groupchat", "last_n_messages": 1},
        "coding": True,
        "library_path": "captainagent_expert_library.json"
    },
    "autobuild_tool_config": {
        "tool_root": "default",  # this will use the tool library we provide
        "retriever": "all-mpnet-base-v2",
    },
    "group_chat_config": {"max_round": 10},
    "group_chat_llm_config": general_llm_config.copy(),
    "max_turns": 3
}

## build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(
    name="captain_agent",
    llm_config=general_llm_config,
    nested_mode_config=nested_mode_config,
)
user_proxy = CaptainUserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
)
query = 'Find the stock price of Microsoft in the past 1 year and plot a line chart to show the trend. Save the line chart as "microsoft_stock_price.png".'
result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(captain_agent, message=query)
```
