Question 1:

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and logically determine the number of whole ice cubes present in the pan at the end of the third minute.

**Given:**

1. Beth placed ice cubes in the pan at the **start** of each minute.
   - 4 ice cubes at the start of the **first** minute.
   - 5 ice cubes at the start of the **second** minute.
   - An unknown number of ice cubes at the start of the **third** minute.
   - None at the fourth minute.
2. The average number of ice cubes **per minute placed** in the pan **while frying the egg** was **five**.

**Objective:**

- Find the number of whole ice cubes present in the pan **at the end of the third minute**.

**Approach:**

1. **Determine the number of minutes the egg was frying (t):**

   - Since ice cubes were added at the start of minutes 1, 2, and 3, and none were added at minute 4, it implies that the egg was fried for **three minutes** (minutes 1-3).

2. **Calculate the total number of ice cubes placed (Total Ice Cubes):**

   - Let \( x \) be the number of ice cubes added at the start of the **third** minute.
   - Total Ice Cubes = Ice cubes added at minute 1 + minute 2 + minute 3
   - Total Ice Cubes = \( 4 + 5 + x = 9 + x \)

3. **Use the average to find \( x \):**

   - The average number of ice cubes placed per minute is given by:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Ice Cubes}}{\text{Total Minutes}} \implies 5 = \frac{9 + x}{3}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     5 = \frac{9 + x}{3} \implies 15 = 9 + x \implies x = 6
     \]

4. **Determine the melting behavior of the ice cubes:**

   - In a hot frying pan, ice cubes would melt relatively quickly.
   - It is reasonable to assume that ice cubes melt **within a minute** due to the heat.

5. **Calculate the number of ice cubes present at the end of the third minute:**

   - Ice cubes added at the **start** of each minute melt during that minute and are **gone by the end** of the minute.
   - Therefore:
     - Ice cubes added at minute 1 are gone by the end of minute 1.
     - Ice cubes added at minute 2 are gone by the end of minute 2.
     - Ice cubes added at minute 3 are gone by the end of minute 3.
   - So, **at the end of the third minute**, all ice cubes have melted.

**Conclusion:**

At the end of the third minute, **there are no whole ice cubes left in the pan**.

**Answer:**

0

(MS: B, which is correct)

Question 2:

To figure out where the purple ball is most likely in relation to the blue ball, let's consider the sequence of events and the physics involved.

1. **She throws a solid blue ball a meter in the air.**
   - The blue ball reaches a maximum height of 1 meter before descending back to the ground.
   - The time it takes for the blue ball to go up and come back down can be calculated using the equations of motion under gravity, but for simplicity, we'll assume it quickly returns to her hand or the ground.

2. **She then throws a solid purple ball (of the same size) two meters in the air.**
   - The purple ball reaches a higher maximum height of 2 meters before descending back to the ground.
   - Similarly, it takes slightly longer than the blue ball to complete its trajectory due to the higher throw.

3. **She climbs to the top of a tall ladder, carefully balancing a yellow balloon on her head.**
   - Climbing a tall ladder takes more time than the balls are in the air. By the time she reaches the top of the ladder, both balls have completed their up-and-down journeys and are most likely back on the ground (or in her hands if she caught them).

**Conclusion:**
- Since both balls have completed their trajectories and there's no indication that she took either ball with her up the ladder, the most likely scenario is that both the blue and the purple balls are at the same heightâ€”either on the ground or wherever she left them after catching.

**Answer:**

**A. at the same height as the blue ball**

(MS: Correct)

Question 3:

To determine who likely finished last, let's analyze the activities and delays of each runner:

**Jeff (63 years old):**
- **Pre-run delay:** Slowly counts from -10 to 10 but forgets a number.
  - Assuming he counts one number per second, and forgetting one number, he takes about 20 seconds.
- **Run speed:** Staggers over the 200m finish line.
  - "Staggering" implies a slow pace.

**Jo (69 years old):**
- **Pre-run delay:** Hurriedly diverts up the stairs of his residential tower.
  - Climbing stairs takes time, but since he does it hurriedly, it's quicker than a normal pace.
- **Pause:** Stops for a couple of seconds to admire the view.
  - This adds about 2 seconds.
- **Run speed:** Races to finish the 200m.
  - "Racing" implies a fast pace.

**Jim (80 years old):**
- **Pre-run delays:**
  - Reads a long tweet.
    - Reading a long tweet may take around 30 seconds.
  - Waves to a fan.
    - This could take a few seconds.
  - Thinks about his dinner.
    - This could add more time, possibly several seconds or more.
- **Run speed:** Walks over the 200m finish line.
  - "Walking" implies the slowest pace among the three.

**Comparing the total times:**
- **Jeff:** 20 seconds (counting) + slow 200m run.
- **Jo:** Time climbing stairs (but hurriedly, so less delay) + 2 seconds (admiring the view) + fast 200m run.
- **Jim:** 30 seconds (tweet) + few seconds (waving) + time thinking + slow 200m walk.

Given that Jeff and Jim both have pre-run delays, but Jeff "staggers" (which, while slow, is faster than walking) and Jim "walks" the 200m, and Jim has more extensive pre-run activities, **Jim likely took the longest time to finish the race**.

**Answer:**

C. Jim likely finished last

(MS: Incorrect)

Question 4:

The correct answer is:

**A. "What would your sister say if I asked her which path leads to the treasure?"**

This classic question is designed to reveal the truth regardless of which sister you ask. Here's why:

- **If you ask Amy (who always speaks mistruths):**
  - Amy knows that Sam always lies. If you asked Sam which path leads to the treasure, Sam would lie and point you to the wrong path.
  - However, since Amy always speaks mistruths (interpreted as always saying the opposite), she'll tell you the opposite of what Sam would say. So Amy ends up pointing you to the correct path.

- **If you ask Sam (who always lies):**
  - Sam knows that Amy speaks mistruths (opposite of the truth). If you asked Amy, she'd point you to the wrong path (since it's the opposite of the truth).
  - But since Sam always lies, she will lie about what Amy would say. So Sam also ends up pointing you to the correct path.

In both cases, the sister you ask ends up directing you to the correct path to the treasure.

---

So, among the options provided, A is the shortest question that will always lead you to the treasure, satisfying the condition that if multiple questions work, the shortest one is the correct choice.

**Answer:** A

(MS: Incorrect)

Question 5 (no reasoning detail provided):

**Answer:** B. definitely

(MS: Correct)

Question 6 (no reasoning detail provided):

**F. the escapades**

(MS: Incorrect)

Question 7 (no reasoning detail provided):

**Answer:**

**B. Yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident**

**Explanation:**

John is described as a "kind, thoughtful, and apologetic person." These character traits suggest that he is someone who cares about others' feelings and takes responsibility, even in situations where he may not be directly at fault. Although John did not cause the lightbulb to fall, he noticed it dropping towards the bald man and was unable to prevent the injury.

Sending a polite apology would be consistent with his character. It would show empathy for the bald man's experience and acknowledge any distress caused by the incident. Additionally, reaching out could help to smooth over any lingering tension, especially since the bald man reacted negatively by cursing and leaving the bathroom upset.

By apologizing, John upholds his values of thoughtfulness and kindness, potentially repairing the social rapport between them.

Question 8:

To determine what the pink-scarfed boy will do, let's carefully follow the scenario and consider what's happening at each step.

1. **Initial Fruits on the Shelf:**
   - Green apple
   - Red pear
   - Pink peach

2. **Students with Scarves:**
   - Green-scarfed student
   - Red-scarfed student
   - Pink-scarfed student

3. **Additional Fruits Placed:**
   - A yellow banana is placed **underneath** the pink peach.
   - A purple plum is placed **on top of** the pink peach.

   *This creates a stack:*
   ```
   Top: Purple plum
        Pink peach
   Bottom: Yellow banana
   ```

4. **Actions of the Students:**
   - The **red-scarfed boy** eats the **red pear**.
   - The **green-scarfed boy** eats the **green apple** **and** **three other fruits**.

5. **Available Fruits After the Red-scarfed Boy Eats:**
   - Green apple
   - The fruit stack:
     - Purple plum (top)
     - Pink peach
     - Yellow banana (bottom)

6. **Fruits the Green-scarfed Boy Eats:**
   - **Green apple**
   - **Purple plum** (accessible at the top of the stack)
   - **Pink peach** (accessible after removing the purple plum)
   - **Yellow banana** (accessible after removing the pink peach)

   *Total fruits eaten by the green-scarfed boy: 4 (green apple + 3 others)*

7. **Remaining Fruits:**
   - None. All fruits have been eaten.

8. **Conclusion for the Pink-scarfed Boy:**
   - There are no fruits left for the pink-scarfed boy to eat.

**Answer: F. eat no fruits**

(MS: Correct)

Question 9:

The key to solving this problem lies in carefully analyzing Agatha's actions:

1. **Sandwich Preparation**: Agatha makes **5 sandwiches in Room A**. So initially, all 5 sandwiches are in Room A.

2. **Attaching the Sandwich**: She uses duct tape to stick the **top surface of the uppermost sandwich** to the **bottom of her walking stick**. This means the top sandwich is now attached to her walking stick.

3. **Moving to Room B**: Agatha then walks to Room B **with her walking stick**. Since the sandwich is attached to the walking stick, it moves with her to Room B.

So, after these actions:

- **Room A**: Left with the remaining **4 sandwiches**.
- **Room B**: Contains **Agatha with her walking stick and the attached sandwich**.

Therefore, there are **4 whole sandwiches in Room A** and **1 whole sandwich in Room B**.

Considering the provided options and accounting for the likely typographical error in the options (where options C and E are intended to be different):

- **Option C** (assuming the intended meaning is 4 sandwiches in Room A and 1 in Room B) correctly represents the situation.

**Answer:** C

(MS: Incorrect)

Question 10:

To determine the approximate position of the glove relative to the center of the bridge after 1 hour, let's analyze the situation step by step.

**1. Glove's Initial Motion:**
- The glove slips out of the car when it's traveling north at 30â€¯km/h.
- As it falls, it retains the car's northward velocity (30â€¯km/h) and begins to descend towards the river.

**2. Time of Descent:**
- Assuming the bridge is about 10 meters above the river (a typical height), the glove takes about 1.43 seconds to fall, calculated using \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \).
- In 1.43 seconds, moving north at 8.33â€¯m/s (which is 30â€¯km/h converted to meters per second), it covers approximately 12 meters northward before hitting the water.

**3. Wind Effect During Descent:**
- The wind is blowing westward at 1â€¯km/h (0.28â€¯m/s).
- In 1.43 seconds, the glove drifts only about 0.4 meters westward â€” negligible compared to other movements.

**4. Motion Upon Hitting the Water:**
- When the glove hits the water, its northward velocity rapidly decreases due to water resistance. Given the glove's small size and the water's resistance, we can assume it nearly stops moving northward.
- The glove then moves eastward with the river's current at 5â€¯km/h.

**5. Position After 1 Hour:**
- Since the glove is carried eastward by the river at 5â€¯km/h, after 1 hour, it will be approximately 5â€¯km east of the bridge.
- Any residual northward movement is minimal and can be neglected for this estimation.
- The wind's effect on the glove floating on the water's surface is negligible compared to the river's current.

**Conclusion:**
- The glove is approximately 5â€¯km eastward of the center of the bridge after one hour.

**Answer:â€ƒF. 5 km+ eastward**
