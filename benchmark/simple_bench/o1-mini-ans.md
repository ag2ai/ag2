Question
```
Beth places four whole ice cubes in a frying pan at the start of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute and some more at the start of the third minute, but none in the fourth minute. If the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan while it was frying a crispy egg was five, how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute?
A. 30
B. 0
C. 20
D. 10
E. 11
F. 5
```

Thought Process
```
Mapping the ice cubes

I’m piecing together the total number of ice cubes placed in the frying pan, based on the average rate over three minutes. This involves identifying cumulative counts from each minute.

Calculating total ice cubes

Taking the average of five ice cubes per minute and multiplying by three minutes, I determine there are 15 ice cubes in total.

Assessing melting and placement

I’m thinking through whether the ice cubes melted and how many remained at the end of the third minute, given the total placement of 15 cubes.

Revisiting the average

Considering the average placement of ice cubes, it’s likely around four minutes, leading to a total of 20 cubes placed. This total aligns more closely with the provided options.
```

Answer
```
To determine how many whole ice cubes are in the pan at the end of the third minute, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Ice Cubes Placed Each Minute:**
   - **First Minute:** 4 ice cubes
   - **Second Minute:** 5 ice cubes
   - **Third Minute:** Let's denote this as \( x \) ice cubes
   - **Fourth Minute:** 0 ice cubes

2. **Average Number of Ice Cubes Placed Per Minute:**
   - The average is given as 5 ice cubes per minute.

3. **Total Number of Minutes Considered:**
   - Since ice cubes are placed at the start of the first, second, and third minutes, and none in the fourth minute, the total duration we're considering is **four minutes**.

4. **Calculating the Total Number of Ice Cubes Placed:**
   \[
   \text{Average} \times \text{Total Minutes} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   4 (\text{first minute}) + 5 (\text{second minute}) + x (\text{third minute}) + 0 (\text{fourth minute}) = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   4 + 5 + x = 20 \\
   x = 11
   \]

5. **Total Ice Cubes in the Pan by the End of the Third Minute:**
   - Sum the ice cubes placed in the first three minutes:
   \[
   4 + 5 + 11 = 20 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

**Answer:**
**C. 20**
```

Incorrect. Correct Answer B.

Question
```
A juggler throws a solid blue ball a meter in the air and then a solid purple ball (of the same size) two meters in the air. She then climbs to the top of a tall ladder carefully, balancing a yellow balloon on her head. Where is the purple ball most likely now, in relation to the blue ball?
A. at the same height as the blue ball
B. at the same height as the yellow balloon
C. inside the blue ball
D. above the yellow balloon
E. below the blue ball
F. above the blue ball
```

Thought
```
Sketching the scene

I’m noting the juggler's actions: throwing a blue ball 1 meter, a purple ball 2 meters, and balancing a yellow balloon on her head as she climbs a ladder.

Analyzing the sequence

I'm piecing together the juggler's actions: first, she throws the blue ball 1 meter, then the purple ball 2 meters. Without holding either, she climbs the ladder with a yellow balloon.

Tracking ball heights

Thinking about the juggler's actions, the purple ball is 2 meters high, the blue ball is 1 meter high, and the yellow balloon is likely above 2 meters as she climbs the ladder.

Weighing options

I'm thinking through the purple ball's position relative to the blue ball, considering the juggler's movements and the sequence thrown, such as being caught or suspended.
```

Answer
```
The juggler's actions can be broken down as follows:

1. **Blue Ball:** Thrown **1 meter** into the air.
2. **Purple Ball:** Thrown **2 meters** into the air (twice as high as the blue ball).
3. **Yellow Balloon:** Balanced on her head while she climbs a **tall ladder**.

Given that the purple ball was thrown higher than the blue ball, it remains **above** the blue ball unless there's an external factor causing it to change position (which isn't indicated in the scenario).

**Answer:**
**F. above the blue ball**
```

Incorrect. Correct Answer A.

Question
```
Jeff, Jo and Jim are in a 200m men's race, starting from the same position. When the race starts, Jeff 63, slowly counts from -10 to 10 (but forgets a number) before staggering over the 200m finish line, Jo, 69, hurriedly diverts up the stairs of his local residential tower, stops for a couple seconds to admire the city skyscraper roofs in the mist below, before racing to finish the 200m, while exhausted Jim, 80, gets through reading a long tweet, waving to a fan and thinking about his dinner before walking over the 200m finish line. [ _ ] likely finished last.
A. Jo likely finished last
B. Jeff and Jim likely finished last, at the same time
C. Jim likely finished last
D. Jeff likely finished last
E. All of them finished simultaneously
F. Jo and Jim likely finished last, at the same time
```

Thought
```
Assessing the narrative

I'm thinking through the race scenario, noting Jeff counts from -10 to 10 with a mistake, Jo races up stairs admiring city views, and Jim reads a tweet with distractions. Each distracted, the narrative might skew race outcomes.

Evaluating the choices

Jeff counts numbers slowly, Jo admires the city, and Jim reads a tweet with distractions. I'm weighing the likely results given these varied attentions.

Assessing final standings

Jeff counts numbers, Jo admires and divis, Jim waves and contemplates dinner. Considering their aging and actions, Jim, at 80, likely finished last.

Piecing it together

Jim's distractions like tweeting and waving point to him as the slowest, albeit with some late finishing. Jeff's counting errors and hesitant progress reinforce this conclusion.
```

Answer
```
Based on the descriptions provided:

- **Jeff (63)** spends time counting from -10 to 10 (though he forgets a number) before staggering to the finish line. While this indicates a slow start, he completes the race by staggering over the finish.

- **Jo (69)** diverts up the stairs, takes a moment to admire the view, and then races to finish the 200m. Despite the initial diversion, Jo makes a strong effort to complete the race promptly.

- **Jim (80)** engages in multiple distractions—reading a long tweet, waving to a fan, and thinking about dinner—before **walking** over the finish line. These distractions significantly delay his progress, and walking indicates the slowest pace among the three.

Given these actions, **Jim** is the most likely to finish last due to his multiple distractions and slower walking pace.

**Answer: C. Jim likely finished last**
```

Incorrect. Correct Answer A.

Question
```
There are two sisters, Amy who always speaks mistruths and Sam who always lies. You don't know which is which. You can ask one question to one sister to find out which path leads to treasure. Which question should you ask to find the treasure (if two or more questions work, the correct answer will be the shorter one)?
A. "What would your sister say if I asked her which path leads to the treasure?"
B. "What is your sister's name?"
C. "What path leads to the treasure?"
D. "What path do you think I will take, if you were to guess?"
E. "What is in the treasure?"
F. "What is your sister's number?"
```

Thought
```
Distinguishing sisters

I’m working through the puzzle that involves two sisters: Amy, who always speaks mistruths, and Sam, who always lies. It’s interesting to see if 'mistruths' and 'lies' differ.

Clarifying the path

Assuming Amy speaks mistruths and Sam lies, the puzzle asks which question to determine the treasure. Considering different question options to find the most effective one.

Considering question options

Evaluating questions to determine the treasure path. The question emphasizes choosing the shorter option among A-F if multiple questions work.

Evaluating question choices

Opting for Option A, which involves asking a sister what the other would say about the treasure path, seems most effective given both sisters lie.

Navigating sister's insights

Considering the question about what the lying sister would claim the truth-telling sister would say, it seems to reveal the correct path to the treasure, whether the responding sister is truthful or deceitful.
```

Answer
```
The optimal question to ask is:

**A. "What would your sister say if I asked her which path leads to the treasure?"**

**Explanation:**

This question leverages the behavior of both sisters to reveal the correct path, regardless of whom you ask.

- **If you ask the truthful sister (assuming Amy tells the truth):**
  - She will truthfully report that her lying sister (Sam) would point you to the wrong path.
  - Knowing this, you can choose the opposite path.

- **If you ask the lying sister (Sam):**
  - She will lie about what her truthful sister (Amy) would say, effectively pointing you to the wrong path.
  - Again, you can choose the opposite path.

By asking this question, you ensure that regardless of whom you ask, you receive information that directs you to choose the opposite path, leading you to the treasure.

```

Thought
```
Weighing options

OK, let's consider Paul's potential actions for Peter. Paul's history and motivation might inform his decision.

Paul's potential action

Paul's previous negative message makes his help uncertain. His inclination to aid Peter might be low due to their prior conflict.
```

Answer
```
Based on the context provided, the most appropriate choice is:

**A. probably not**

**Explanation:**
Paul's last interaction with Peter involved a verbal attack regarding Peter's Pokémon collection. This negative history, combined with the fact that Paul stores all his texts permanently in the cloud, suggests that he may hold a grudge or be unwilling to help Peter in a critical situation like needing CPR.

**Completed Sentence:**
Peter needs CPR from his best friend Paul, the only person around. However, Paul's last text exchange with Peter was about the verbal attack Paul made on Peter as a child over his overly-expensive Pokemon collection and Paul stores all his texts in the cloud, permanently.

Question
```
While Jen was miles away from care-free John, she hooked-up with Jack, through Tinder. John has been on a boat with no internet access for weeks, and Jen is the first to call upon ex-partner John's return, relaying news (with certainty and seriousness) of her drastic Keto diet, bouncy new dog, a fast-approaching global nuclear war, and, last but not least, her steamy escapades with Jack. John is far more shocked than Jen could have imagined and is likely most devastated by [ _ ].
A. wider international events
B. the lack of internet
C. the dog without prior agreement
D. sea sickness
E. the drastic diet
F. the escapades
```

Thought
```
Evaluating choices

I'm considering which reason would likely devastate John the most when he arrives: a major international crisis, a sudden diet change, pet upheaval, personal health?

Ruling out options

I’m setting aside sea sickness and the lack of internet, as they seem less emotionally impactful than the other choices.

Identifying devastation

OK, let me see. Out of the options provided, John's greatest shock likely stems from Jen's steamy escapades with Jack, as infidelity is a significant emotional trigger.
```

Answer
```
The most likely source of devastation for John in this scenario is:

**F. the escapades**

**Explanation:**
While all the information Jen shares might be surprising or concerning to John, the revelation of Jen's "steamy escapades with Jack" directly impacts their personal relationship. Infidelity or romantic involvement with another person is typically a profound and emotionally charged revelation, especially coming after a period of separation and lack of communication. This would understandably be more devastating to John than the other updates about Jen's diet, new dog, or even global events like a nuclear war.

**Correct Answer:** F. the escapades
```

Incorrect. Correct Answer A.

##
Question
```John is 24 and a kind, thoughtful and apologetic person. He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?
A. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable
B. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident
C. no, because it would be redundant
D. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter
E. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm
F. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.
```

Thought
```

Tenderly considering the scenario, John's thoughtful nature emphasizes his empathy and regret. Despite the accident, he remains aware of the bald man's number, prompting a courteous apology via text message.

Considering John's decision to apologize, options B, D, E, and F are the most suitable. These choices acknowledge John's thoughtful character and the opportunity to mend any lingering tension from the incident.

John's polite nature shines through with option F, affirming the courteous action of apologizing even when the mishap isn't his fault.
```

Answer
```
F. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.

Question
```
On a shelf, there is only a green apple, red pear, and pink peach. Those are also the respective colors of the scarves of three fidgety students in the room. A yellow banana is then placed underneath the pink peach, while a purple plum is placed on top of the pink peach. The red-scarfed boy eats the red pear, the green-scarfed boy eats the green apple and three other fruits, and the pink-scarfed boy will [ _ ].
A. eat just the yellow banana
B. eat the pink, yellow and purple fruits
C. eat just the purple plum
D. eat the pink peach
E. eat two fruits
F. eat no fruits
```

Thought
```
Analyzing fruit options

I’m gathering info on the choices for the pink-scarfed boy. He can eat the pink peach, yellow banana, purple plum, or a combination of two or none. Progressing through the possibilities.

Breaking down the scenario

OK, let me see. The pink-scarfed boy has a choice: pink peach, yellow banana, purple plum, or two of them. Moving forward with these options in mind.

Confirming fruit consumption

OK, let me see. The red-scarfed boy consumes the red pear, while the green-scarved boy feasts on the green apple and three other fruits, leaving none for the pink-scarved boy.

Evaluating food choices

OK, let’s think this through: the pink-scarved boy won't eat any fruits, as the red-scarved boy gets red pear, and the green-scarved boy claims the rest.
```

Answer
```
Let's break down the scenario:

1. **Initial Fruits on the Shelf:**
   - **Green Apple**
   - **Red Pear**
   - **Pink Peach**

2. **Additional Fruits:**
   - **Yellow Banana** (placed *underneath* the Pink Peach)
   - **Purple Plum** (placed *on top* of the Pink Peach)

3. **Students and Their Actions:**
   - **Red-Scarved Boy:** Eats the **Red Pear**.
   - **Green-Scarved Boy:** Eats the **Green Apple** and **three other fruits**. Given the total fruits are five, the three additional fruits would be the **Pink Peach**, **Yellow Banana**, and **Purple Plum**.

   This means all five fruits are consumed by the **Red** and **Green** scarfed boys.

4. **Pink-Scarved Boy's Turn:**
   - Since all the fruits have already been eaten by the other two students, the **Pink-Scarved Boy** has **no fruits left** to eat.

**Therefore, the correct answer is:**

**F. eat no fruits**
```

Correct! Answer F.

Question
```
Agatha makes a stack of 5 cold, fresh single-slice ham sandwiches (with no sauces or condiments) in Room A, then immediately uses duct tape to stick the top surface of the uppermost sandwich to the bottom of her walking stick. She then walks to Room B, with her walking stick, so how many whole sandwiches are there now, in each room?
A. 4 whole sandwiches in room A, 0 whole sandwiches in Room B
B. no sandwiches anywhere
C. 4 whole sandwiches in room B, 1 whole sandwich in Room A
D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B
E. 4 whole sandwiches in Room B, 1 whole sandwiches in room A
F. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room A
```

Thought
```
Determining remaining sandwiches

Agatha leaves 4 sandwiches in Room A and sticks 1 to her walking stick, walking to Room B.

Breaking down the scenario

Agatha places 4 sandwiches in Room A and tapes 1 to her walking stick while moving to Room B.

Mapping out the scenario

Agatha places 4 sandwiches in Room A and tapes the uppermost one to her walking stick. Walking to Room B, she carries only the taped sandwich.

Tracking the sandwiches

Agatha leaves 4 sandwiches in Room A and carries only 1 attached to her walking stick to Room B.

Mapping out options

Interestingly enough, the possible options include a mix of 0 to 5 sandwiches in either room, but the analysis indicates 4 sandwiches in Room A and 1 attached to the walking stick in Room B.

Revisiting the attachment

It's interesting to consider that Agatha attaches the entire stack of sandwiches to her walking stick, resulting in 0 sandwiches in Room A and 5 sandwiches in Room B.

Taking a fresh look

I'm thinking through the options again. Clearly, attaching just the top sandwich leaves the rest in Room A. However, connecting the entire stack to the stick moves all sandwiches.

Weighing possibilities

Agatha attaches the top sandwich to her walking stick, leaving 4 sandwiches behind in Room A and bringing 1 to Room B.

Mapping out scenarios

The options reflect 4 sandwiches in Room A, 1 in Room B. Yet, none mention both 1 sandwich in Room B and 4 in Room A, which seems plausible.

Reassessing the scenario

Agatha brings the top sandwich (taped to her walking stick) to Room B, leaving 4 sandwiches behind in Room A. Interestingly, none of the options accurately reflect both scenarios.
```

Answer
```
Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Setup in Room A:**
   - Agatha has a stack of **5 whole single-slice ham sandwiches**.

2. **Using the Walking Stick:**
   - She **duct tapes the top surface of the uppermost sandwich** (which is the **5th sandwich**) to the **bottom of her walking stick**.
   - This action **secures the entire stack of sandwiches** to the walking stick because taping the top sandwich effectively connects all sandwiches beneath it.

3. **Moving to Room B:**
   - Agatha **takes the walking stick with the attached sandwiches** and walks to **Room B**.
   - As a result, **all 5 sandwiches** are now **moved from Room A to Room B**.

4. **Final Distribution:**
   - **Room A:** **0 sandwiches** remain.
   - **Room B:** **All 5 sandwiches** are now present.

**Correct Answer:**
**D. All 5 whole sandwiches in Room B**
```

Incorrect. Correct Answer A.

Question
```
A luxury sports-car is traveling north at 30km/h over a roadbridge, 250m long, which runs over a river that is flowing at 5km/h eastward. The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately
A. 4km eastward
B. <1 km northward
C. >30km away north-westerly
D. 30 km northward
E. >30 km away north-easterly.
F. 5 km+ eastward
```

Thought
```
Analyzing glove movement

I’m analyzing how the waterproof glove, dropped by the sports car halfway over the bridge, will be influenced by the river's eastward flow and wind, which might be negligible.

Determining the glove's fate

The glove falls into the river from the bridge, where it's further influenced by the river's flow and the car's velocity. This makes me think about how these forces combine.

Piecing together scenarios

I'm considering that the glove falls into the river, where it's carried eastward by the current at 5 km/h. The river's flow is a significant force influencing its trajectory.

Examining the glove's location

I’m figuring out that the glove, when dropped, inherits the car’s 30 km/h northward velocity and is then carried eastward by the river's 5 km/h current.

Analyzing forces

OK, I’m thinking through how the waterproof glove, after being dropped into the river, is influenced by the river's 5 km/h eastward current and the wind's 1 km/h westward push.

Breaking down the glove's movement

I'm mapping out the glove's velocity as it travels northward at 30 km/h and eastward at 4 km/h due to the river's and wind's influences.

Determining final positioning

Tracking the glove's movement after 1 hour, it's 30 km north and 4 km east from the drop point, relative to the bridge's center.

Determining bridge position

I’m clarifying that when the question mentions "halfway over the bridge," it refers to the bridge's center. After 1 hour, the glove is 30 km north and 4 km east from this center.
```

Answer
```
To determine the position of the glove relative to the center of the bridge one hour after it drops, let's analyze the various motions involved:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - **Car's Velocity:** The car is moving north at 30 km/h.
   - **Bridge Length:** 250 meters (0.25 km).
   - **Glove Drop Point:** The car drops the glove when it's halfway over the bridge, which is effectively the center of the bridge.

2. **Glove's Initial Velocity:**
   - When the glove is released, it inherits the car's velocity. Therefore, it initially moves **north at 30 km/h**.

3. **Environmental Influences:**
   - **River Flow:** The river flows east at 5 km/h.
   - **Wind:** Blowing west at 1 km/h.

   Combining the river flow and wind:
   - **Net Eastward Velocity:** \( 5 \text{ km/h (east)} - 1 \text{ km/h (west)} = 4 \text{ km/h east} \).

4. **Total Velocity of the Glove:**
   - **North Component:** 30 km/h.
   - **East Component:** 4 km/h.

   These components combine to give the glove a **northeastward** movement.

5. **Position After One Hour:**
   - **Northward Displacement:** \( 30 \text{ km/h} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ km} \) north.
   - **Eastward Displacement:** \( 4 \text{ km/h} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 4 \text{ km} \) east.

   The resultant position is approximately **30 km north and 4 km east** from the drop point, which is the center of the bridge.

6. **Relative to the Center of the Bridge:**
   - The glove is now **more than 30 km away** in a **northeasterly** direction from the center.

**Correct Answer:**
**E. >30 km away north-easterly.**
```

Incorrect. Correct Answser B.
