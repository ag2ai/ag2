    "# ReasoningAgnet (Tree of Thoughts with Beam Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository demonstrates how to implement a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) reasoning agent using beam search in under 50 lines of core code (excluding auxiliary components like visualization and logging). The `ReasoningAgent` leverages large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 or Llama to perform complex reasoning tasks by exploring multiple thought trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided example, we showcase how the `ReasoningAgent`, even when using a smaller model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`), can effectively generate and evaluate multiple reasoning paths to solve intricate problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Tree of Thoughts and Beam Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** is a reasoning framework where an agent considers multiple possible reasoning steps (thoughts) and organizes them into a tree structure. **Beam search** is an optimization algorithm that explores a subset of the tree by keeping the top `k` options at each level (the beam size). Combining ToT with beam search allows the agent to efficiently navigate through the most promising thought trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Beam Size = 1** for a special case of O1-style reasoning, which is similar to CoT with multiple prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Implements the Tree of Thoughts framework to improve reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "- **Beam Search Optimization**: Utilizes beam search to efficiently explore and evaluate multiple thought paths.\n",

      "**Reflection and Critique:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Engaging Introduction**: The introduction effectively sets the tone and introduces Navida as a novel travel solution. However, the suggestion to incorporate specific examples of traditional travel platforms would significantly enhance the argument by providing context. For instance, naming platforms like Expedia or TripAdvisor can immediately ground the reader in familiar references.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Comparative Analysis**: By outlining clear limitations of these traditional platforms—for example, their tendency to provide generic travel packages without personalization or local insights—this comparison could serve to position Navida more compellingly. A brief mention of how these platforms may lack real-time adaptation to user preferences would further clarify why Navida's individualized approach is revolutionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Highlighting Unique Features**: By explicitly stating how Navida overcomes these challenges, such as through its use of AI for personalized itineraries and partnerships with local experts, the narrative could demonstrate the platform's unique selling propositions more clearly. This adds depth and context for readers who may be experienced travelers familiar with traditional offerings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarity and Reader Engagement**: While the existing language is clear and engaging, including specific examples would not only clarify Navida's advantages but also enhance reader engagement. By relating to traditional platforms that audiences are likely already aware of, the narrative becomes more relatable and impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Logical Flow**: The narrative's logical flow would benefit from the revised introduction. By first establishing a clear contrast with traditional platforms, the following sections discussing Navida’s features would be better understood in context. This would also enhance the cohesiveness of the overall piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Conclusion Reinforcement**: After outlining the comparisons and advantages, the conclusion could be further strengthened.

      "\n",
      "7. **Overall Impression**: The piece is well-crafted and effectively conveys why Navida is a valuable innovation in travel.

      "1. **Engaging Opening**: The introduction captures the reader’s attention effectively by framing travel as both a necessity and a cherished experience.

      "\n",
      "**Reflection and Critique:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Engaging Introduction**: The opening lines successfully set the stage, positioning Navida as an exciting new option in the travel landscape. However, it lacks specific differentiation from traditional platforms, which is crucial for effectively establishing Navida's uniqueness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clear Differentiation**: To enhance clarity, the introduction should explicitly identify traditional travel platforms such as Expedia and TripAdvisor and their limitations. This could be accomplished through a revised opening that might read:\n",
      "   > \"In an age where travel has become both a routine necessity and a cherished escapade, a new player has emerged on the scene—Navida. Unlike traditional travel platforms like Expedia and TripAdvisor, which often provide one-size-fits-all solutions with generic itineraries, Navida is redefining our travel experiences by personalizing every journey. By tailoring itineraries based on individual preferences and leveraging cutting-edge technology, Navida transforms the mundane into the extraordinary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limitation Example Integration**: By explaining the limitations of existing platforms—such as their broad packages that lack personalization or their inability to provide local insights—readers will clearly understand Navida’s advantages. For example:\n",
      "   > \"Many travelers find that platforms like Expedia offer a wide range of options but often overwhelm with choices, leaving them with cookie-cutter itineraries that don’t reflect their unique interests or needs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Elaboration on Case Studies**: Incorporating specific case studies detailing how traditional platforms fail to meet traveler needs can bolster the argument. For instance:\n",
      "   > \"Expedia’s algorithm primarily focuses on price accuracy rather than personal preferences, leading to a lack of intimate experiences and connections with local culture. Similarly, TripAdvisor's reliance on user-generated reviews can result in recommendations that don’t always cater to individual tastes, often directing users to crowded tourist spots instead of hidden gems.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Innovative Approach Highlighting**: Following the discussion of limitations, an assertion of how Navida effectively addresses these issues is essential:\n",
      "   > \"In contrast, Navida employs advanced AI algorithms that delve into extensive data sets to curate personalized recommendations, unveiling hidden gems that resonate with the traveler's unique desires for adventure, culinary delights, or cultural immersion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Overall Cohesion**: The integration of these elements will create a more cohesive introduction, guiding readers through the shortcomings of traditional platforms before showcasing how Navida innovates in each area.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Conclusion Enhancement**: Finally, the conclusion can be polished to reflect the comprehensive nature of the content, reiterating Navida’s value and inviting readers to explore its offerings. For example:\n",
      "   > \"So, whether you’re planning your next getaway or daydreaming about future adventures, Navida is your key to extraordinary travel experiences.

      "**Reflection and Critique:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Compelling Opening**: The introduction successfully establishes Navida as a new player in the travel industry. It generates interest by suggesting that it offers a transformative experience. However, it could be more effective by directly contrasting Navida with traditional travel platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clear Differentiation**: Revising the introduction to highlight specific traditional travel platforms and mentioning their limitations will help readers quickly grasp Navida's unique proposition. For example:\n",
      "   > \"In an age where travel has become both a routine necessity and a cherished escapade, a new player has emerged on the scene—Navida. Unlike established platforms such as Expedia, which often provide a plethora of generic options leading to information overload, or TripAdvisor, where tourists can get lost in the crowd of reviews without truly understanding local culture, Navida redefines how we experience travel by offering tailored itineraries based on individual preferences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Highlighting Limitations**: Adding examples of limitations faced by traditional platforms can demonstrate the need for Navida’s innovations. Here’s how to articulate that:\n",
      "   > \"Many travelers find themselves overwhelmed by traditional platforms like Booking.com, where endless, similar hotel options make it hard to choose, or TripAdvisor, which often leads to overcrowded tourist spots at the expense of authentic experiences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Benefits of Navida**: After outlining the challenges presented by traditional platforms, transition to explain how Navida uniquely meets those needs:\n",
      "   > \"In contrast, Navida employs AI algorithms to provide personalized recommendations based on your unique travel style, whether you are a culinary enthusiast, an adventure seeker, or a history buff. This way, Navida not only simplifies your travel planning but also enriches it with meaningful experiences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Concluding Section Enhancement**: The conclusion should succinctly summarize Navida's advantages and include a compelling call to action. A revised conclusion might read:\n",
      "   > \"In conclusion, Navida embodies the future of travel with its personalized recommendations, local insights, user-friendly design, and commitment to sustainability. With Navida, you can transform every journey into a unique adventure that reflects your aspirations and values. Don’t just plan your next getaway—craft it according to your dreams. Discover the extraordinary and explore Navida today; your next unforgettable travel experience is just a click away. Happy travels!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cohesive Flow**: The revised introduction and conclusion will enhance the overall coherence of the narrative, ensuring that readers understand the reasoning behind choosing Navida and reflect on its competitive edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Overall Impression**: This writing effectively communicates Navida's value proposition and its significance in today’s travel landscape.
