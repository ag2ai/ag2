    "# ReasoningAgnet (Tree of Thoughts with Beam Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository demonstrates how to implement a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) reasoning agent using beam search in under 50 lines of core code (excluding auxiliary components like visualization and logging). The `ReasoningAgent` leverages large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 or Llama to perform complex reasoning tasks by exploring multiple thought trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided example, we showcase how the `ReasoningAgent`, even when using a smaller model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`), can effectively generate and evaluate multiple reasoning paths to solve intricate problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Tree of Thoughts and Beam Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** is a reasoning framework where an agent considers multiple possible reasoning steps (thoughts) and organizes them into a tree structure. **Beam search** is an optimization algorithm that explores a subset of the tree by keeping the top `k` options at each level (the beam size). Combining ToT with beam search allows the agent to efficiently navigate through the most promising thought trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Beam Size = 1** for a special case of O1-style reasoning, which is similar to CoT with multiple prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Implements the Tree of Thoughts framework to improve reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "- **Beam Search Optimization**: Utilizes beam search to efficiently explore and evaluate multiple thought paths.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Includes a thinker agent to generate possible next steps and a grader agent to evaluate them.\n",
    "- **Visualization Support**: Provides visualization of the thought tree using Graphviz for better analysis.\n",
    "- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows configuration of maximum depth, beam size, and answer selection approach."
