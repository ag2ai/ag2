    "To get started with the `crawl4ai` integration in AG2, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install AG2 with the `crawl4ai` extra:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install ag2[crawl4ai]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   > **Note:** If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:  \n",
    "   > ```bash\n",
    "   > pip install -U autogen[crawl4ai]\n",
    "   > ```\n",
    "   > or  \n",
    "   > ```bash\n",
    "   > pip install -U pyautogen[crawl4ai]\n",
    "   > ```\n",
    "   > as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.  \n",
    "2. Set up Playwright:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Installs Playwright and browsers for all OS\n",
    "   playwright install\n",
    "   # Additional command, mandatory for Linux only\n",
    "   playwright install-deps\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "3. For running the code in Jupyter, use `nest_asyncio` to allow nested event loops.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install nest_asyncio\n",
