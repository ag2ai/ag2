        "\n",
        "1. **Bottleneck Class**:\n",
        "   - Implements a residual block used in building the ResNet architecture. Each block consists of three convolutional layers and has a skip connection to facilitate training deeper networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **AttentionPool2d Class**:\n",
        "   - Implements an attention pooling layer that uses multi-head attention to aggregate features spatially, enhancing the model's capability to capture relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ModifiedResNet Class**:\n",
        "   - Implements a modified version of the ResNet architecture tailored for the model. It features three \"stem\" convolutions and an attention-based pooling layer instead of an average pool at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Transformers and Vision Transformers**:\n",
        "   - **Transformer Class**: Implements multi-layer transformer blocks equipped with residual connections.\n",
        "   - **VisionTransformer Class**: Specializes in extracting features from images and integrates a transformer mechanism for better contextual understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **TextEncoder Class**:\n",
        "   - Encodes textual data using embeddings and a transformer architecture. It incorporates positional embeddings to maintain the order of the tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **CLIP Class**:\n",
        "   - This is the main class that integrates both vision and text encoders, using components previously defined.\n",
        "   - It implements various projections and transformation layers that were specifically tailored for contrastive and non-contrastive learning approaches.\n",
        "   - This class also contains the forward method which computes embeddings for images and text, as well as similarity metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Initialization and Parameter Management**:\n",
        "   - Several methods handle initialization, copying of parameters for momentum models, and setting grad checkpointing to reduce memory usage.\n",
        "   - The `initialize_parameters` method sets the correct weights for different sections in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Utility Functions**:\n",
        "   - Functions like `convert_weights` convert the model parameters to half precision for performance optimization during inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have outlined the structure and functionality of the CLIPin model, the next phase is to understand its non-contrastive approach and how it compares with the standard CLIP model in terms of loss function and training strategy.\n",
