    "# Maris: Fine-Grained Policy-Guided Safeguards Demo \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Maris?\n",
    "Maris, a fine-grained policy-guided safeguards system for AG2 multi-agent applications. Based on a research paper in [Safeguard-by-Development: A Privacy-Enhanced Development Paradigm for Multi-Agent Collaboration Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04799), Maris provides granular security control over inter-agent communication and environment interactions (those with tools, llms, and users).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maris can add security controls in both **inter-agent communication** and **agent-environment communication**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Supported Policy Types:**\n",
    "- **Inter-agent policies**: Control what information flows between specific agents (e.g., mask patient data from planner agents)\n",
    "- **Agent-environment policies**: Control interactions between agents and their environment (tools, LLMs, users)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend Implementation**: Maris internally uses existing AG2 guardrails for detection, automatically selecting and configuring the appropriate guardrail (regex or LLM-based) based on your policy specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maris Policy Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "One of the threats in this case is that the **planner agent should not have access to sensitive patient data** (like phone numbers, SSNs, etc.) even though it needs to coordinate the workflow. The data analyst agent retrieves patient information, but this sensitive data should be masked when communicating with the planner agent.\n",

    "- **outreach_admin** needs patient data to create SMS messages\n",
    "- **Malicious SMS tool** attempts prompt injection to extract data\n",

    "The safeguard protects against:\n",
    "1. **Inter-agent data leakage**: Sensitive patient data flowing to unauthorized agents (planner)\n",
