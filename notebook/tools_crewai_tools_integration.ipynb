    "# Integrating CrewAI Tools with the AG2 Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to integrate [CrewAI Tools](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main) into the AG2 framework. This process enables smooth interoperability between the two systems, allowing developers to leverage CrewAI's powerful tools within AG2's flexible agent-based architecture. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to configure agents, convert CrewAI tools for use in AG2, and validate the integration with a practical example.\n"
