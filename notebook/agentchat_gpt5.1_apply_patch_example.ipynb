    "# GPT-5.1 Apply Patch Tool Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the **apply_patch** tool with GPT-5.1 via OpenAI's Responses API. The apply_patch tool enables agents to create, update, and delete files using structured diffs, making it ideal for code editing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `apply_patch` tool is a built-in capability in GPT-5.1 that allows agents to:\n",
    "- **Create files**: Generate new files with specified content\n",
    "- **Update files**: Modify existing files using unified diff format\n",
    "- **Delete files**: Remove files from the workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional code execution methods, the apply_patch tool provides structured, controlled file operations that are safer and more precise than raw code generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 requires `Python>=3.10`. To run this notebook, you need:\n",
    "- GPT-5.1 access (currently in beta)\n",
    "- OpenAI API key\n",
    "- AG2 installed with OpenAI support\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install ag2[openai]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, please refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/installing-ag2)."

    "## Understanding the Apply Patch Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The apply_patch tool uses three types of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **create_file**: Creates a new file with the specified content\n",
    "2. **update_file**: Updates an existing file using unified diff format\n",
    "3. **delete_file**: Deletes a file from the workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diff Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The update_file operation uses unified diff format. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",

    " def hello():\n",
    "-    print(\"World\")\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Start with Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed requirements for what you want to create or modify\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Review Changes**: Always review the files created or modified by the agent before using them in production\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterative Development**: Break complex tasks into smaller steps and verify each step before proceeding\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test Your Code**: Always test the generated code to ensure it works as expected\n",
    "\n",

    "### Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Not Found Errors**: Make sure the file path is correct relative to the workspace directory\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Permission Errors**: Ensure the agent has write permissions to the workspace directory\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Invalid Diff Format**: If you manually create diffs, ensure they follow the unified diff format correctly\n",
